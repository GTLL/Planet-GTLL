Goals for the Planetoid project
===============================

- "Better planet than planetplanet"

Why better?

- Uses "standard" templating engine (ex: Jinja)
- Archives
- Filters <- killer feature for me

But still:

- Hype-easy to deploy

Architecture
------------

- Use Flask
- Databased-backed (Which DB?)
- Dynamic + static site generation
- Uses feeparser
- Has unit tests
- 1-line deploy using Fabric
- 2 main processes communicating by sharing the database:
  - 1 server (serves web pages)
  - 1 crawler (crawls feeds)
